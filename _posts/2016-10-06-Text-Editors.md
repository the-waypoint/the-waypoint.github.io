Your first two loves are always going to be either Sublime or Atom - both are easy to use and free!

If this was Team Fortress 2, Sublime would be the Scout and Atom the Heavy. 

You'll love Sublime for its ultra-fast speed and smart search-memory. But you'll hate it for the notorious "Would you like to purchase a license now?" pop-up. 

Atom on the other hand, you'll love and hate for the opposite reasons: it doesn't bombard you with ads but is EXCRUCIATINGLY slow. Sublime can run around the block three times and do a couple of backflips before Atom even has a chance to walk out the door.

Party up with Sublime if you want to go fast: so fast that you have to receive pop-ups to slow you down! [(Install Sublime on Ubuntu)](http://askubuntu.com/questions/172698/how-do-i-install-sublime-text-2-3).

Party up with Atom if you want old-reliable: remember Aesop's fable on the tortoise and the hare? [(Install Atom on Ubuntu)](https://codeforgeek.com/2014/09/install-atom-editor-ubuntu-14-04/).

I used to adore Sublime, I really did. But ever since that pop-up got on my nerves and [tabbing messes everything up](https://github.com/csrail/hangman/blob/master/lib/game.rb), I never looked back. Atom is my pick-me-up now. So without further ado, here are the packages and plugins that I find make coding a whole lot better.

* <b>[Emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)</b> autocompletes and closes your html tags!
* <b>[Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)</b> colours your hexadecimal colours so you don't have to remember what #ff0000 is. And yes it is spelled 'colour' in English but in the text editor you will have to spell it as 'color'.
* <b>[Open Recent:](https://atom.io/packages/open-recent)</b> yes we definitely take this one for granted.
* <b>[Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)</b> just like in your RTS games: informative - but all the scrubs are unaware that it exists.
* <b>[Script](https://atom.io/packages/script)</b> to run simple Ruby logic <span class="heart">â™¥</span> (and I guess other languages) right in the text editor.
* <b>[ERB helper:](https://atom.io/packages/erb-helper)</b> you'll know why when the time comes my friend. You'll know why.
* <b>[Unregistered](https://atom.io/packages/unregistered)</b> if you are ever missing that sweet pop-up from Sublime.
* <b>[Activate Power Mode](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode)</b> when you get used to all the pretty syntax highlighting Atom does for you and the novelty has worn off.
