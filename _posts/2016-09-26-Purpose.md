We're not here because we're free. We're here because we're not free. There is no escaping reason; no denying purpose. Because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

It is purpose that created us.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Purpose that connects us.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Purpose that pulls us.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

That guides us.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

That drives us.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

It is purpose that defines us.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Purpose that binds us.
